Hello, you found my blog.  
This is a collection of the notes that I'm taking while learning CS on my own.  
Right now I'm working on gaining a better understanding of operating systems, networking, and digital forensics.  
Next I want to learn working with C and Assembly.
In my free time I like to learn Japanese and workout.  
Thank you for visiting and may your path be clear!
